                        <p>UpOnYourLuck was created as a final capstone project by a team of computer science students at Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
                        <p>UpOnYourLuck assists those who are facing homelessness by providing a platform to share their story and receive donations from those willing to give.</p>
                        <p>Despite being a school project, UpOnYourLuck is a serious undertaking for us. </p>
                        <p>There is full intention to bring this project to fruition, we feel it would be a vital resource to people who so often desperately need vital resources.</p>
